⚡ Developer Portfolio – A Code-Inspired Interactive Portfolio
Welcome to my interactive developer portfolio, designed with a modern, code-editor-inspired interface. This is not just a portfolio — it's a creative playground that reflects my personality, skills, and the way I think as a developer.

🧠 Key Features
📂 File-based Navigation: Inspired by VS Code, navigate through different "files" like about.tsx, skills.tsx, and projects.tsx to explore my journey.

🎮 Fun Interactions: Includes playful elements like a terminal simulator and an anime-themed easter egg for those who explore deeper.

🧪 Terminal Mode: A built-in terminal-style interface allows visitors to explore sections via commands like open about or even trigger secret modes.

🎨 Theme Switcher: Multiple hand-crafted themes including Dark, Light, Cyberpunk, and an Anime Mode that adds flair for fans of Japanese animation.

🔊 Dynamic Compliment Generator: An interactive terminal feature that delivers random compliments in a developer-style tone.

📱 Fully Responsive: Works beautifully across all devices — from desktops to smartphones.

🧩 Hidden Easter Eggs: Find hidden features through playful experimentation with commands or clicks. One of them launches an exclusive anime experience.

🔍 Upcoming Features / Ideas
future-you.tsx: A futuristic "video call" with my future self.

game-mode.tsx: A mini RPG-style game to collect skills as achievements.

voice.tsx: A voice-controlled navigation assistant for hands-free exploration.

Built to break the traditional portfolio mold and leave a memorable impression.

Feel free to fork it, explore the code, and get inspired!
